### About the app
The Chewy Recipe App is a project that stemmed from my friends having their recipes on index cards and I told them that I was going to develop an application that would manage recipes much like their index card system.  

###About the GUI
![alt-text] (https://github.com/JohnJoeGarza/Chewy_Recipe_App/blob/master/Design_Elements/Main_Window.JPG)

The main window of the application shows the user a table that contains all the current recipes that are in the database. There are buttons that provide interaction with the database which are:
* View Recipe: Used to open a window that relevent recipe information of the selected recipe.
* Add New Recipe: Used to open a window that allows a user to add a new recipe to the database.
* Edit Recipe: Used to open a window that allows the user to edit the currently selected recipe.
* Search Recipe: Used to open a window that will allow a user to search for a recipe.
* Delete Recipe: Used to delete the current selected recipe.



Work still in progress as of 2/14/2017
